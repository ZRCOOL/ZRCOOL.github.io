1. We are setting <b>onDelete</b>Job to <b>CASCADE</b>which means if a job gets deleted all it's applicants should also be removed<br/>
2. In the applicants we setting <b>onDelete</b>relation to <b>SET_NULL (default behaviour)</b>that means removing a individual applicant should not remove a Job</span></body></html>
